# flask_translator
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jakkso/flask_translator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jakkso/flask_translator)
---
Basic CRUD app that interfaces with azure's text translate api

Backend is `flask` and `flask_restful` sitting behind `nginx` and `uWSGI`; frontend is `react` and `material-ui` being served by `nginx`

Running in Docker.  Someone has to have gotten bingo by now, I said enough buzzwords, right? :)
